# Calculator

React Calculator! A Classic Project!

#### Live Site https://calculator-youkaithegreat.netlify.app/

##### Primary Technology Used: ReactJS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Grid

Since it's just a very basic calculator application, there wasn't really any logic or improvements I felt like were necessary.

If I revisit it in the future, I may try to include something like exponents or squareroot. For larger numbers I could add in scientific notation.

Part of an effort to build a repertoire of smaller "standard" projects.

###### Successes

- Understood the concept of the video and was able to pre-code ahead of the video in anticipation of his next step
- Familiarized self with the useReducer hook
- First Complete ReactJS Project

###### Challenges

- Deploying to Netlify was not something included in the video, had to check that the build, run and routing files were correct
- He skips a step about halfway through and the comments in the video helped remedy that
- There were no React Version conflicts for this project

###### Resources Used

Initial Project used base "Create React App" starter files.
